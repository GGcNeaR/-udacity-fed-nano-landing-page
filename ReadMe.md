# Borislav's Landing Page for Udacity FEWD

This is my second project - Landing Page

## Description

I have a `LandingPage` class that is responsible for initializing the page content and behaviour.
There are 4 dynamically added sections and corresponding menu items for each of them. The menu items scroll to the sections upon click. Upon scroll, there is logic that keeps track of the currently active section and highlights its menu item.
